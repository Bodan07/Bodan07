#  I'm Kamil! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
👋 Hi there! I'm Kamil, a computer science student from Telkom University in Bandung, Indonesia.

🎮 Outside the world of coding, you can often find me immersed in the world of games, where I love to explore virtual realms and conquer challenges.

🎧 When not coding or gaming, I unwind by listening to music. Whether it's a coding session playlist or a chill-out mix, music is the soundtrack to my coding adventures.

🌐 Currently honing my skills in software development, I enjoy tackling challenges and turning ideas into functional code.

📚 Always eager to learn and explore new technologies, I'm on a journey to expand my knowledge and contribute to the world of open source.

🔧 Let's connect and collaborate! Feel free to explore my repositories and join me on this coding and gaming adventure. 🚀

## 🛠 Skills

🚀 I'm passionate about coding and have dived into a variety of languages, including Python, Java, C++, Golang, C, Flutter Dart, and HTML.
